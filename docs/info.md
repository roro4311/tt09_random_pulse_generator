## How it works

The Random Pulse Generator simulates a radioactive source by producing pulses at random intervals. The core mechanism behind pulse generation is based on a 16-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), which generates random numbers that control the timing of pulses. These pulses are used as a representation of particle decay or other phenomena that can be modeled by random intervals.

The algorithm simulates the exponential decay of materials by generating pulses at random intervals that depend on the output of the LFSR. The frequency of these pulses is determined by the comparison between a counter and the random number generated by the LFSR. When the counter exceeds the random value, a pulse is generated, and the counter resets, mimicking a "decay event."

## How to test

1. **Initialization**: To start the pulse generation, apply a reset signal (`rst_n`). Once the reset is released, the generator will start producing pulses automatically.

2. **Pulse Generation**: The pulse output (`uio_out[0]`) will periodically go high, indicating a pulse. The random timing of these pulses simulates the randomness in a radioactive decay process.

3. **Observation**: You can observe the output pulses at `uio_out[0]` using a logic analyzer or simulation environment. The pulse will be generated at random intervals, with the duration of inactivity (no pulse) varying due to the randomization mechanism.

4. **Re-initialization**: If needed, the reset signal can be applied again to restart the pulse generation from the initial state.

5. **Verification**: After some clock cycles, check if the pulse is generated at least once. The pulse should be visible on `uio_out[0]` and will toggle between high and low states based on the pulse generation logic.

## External hardware

No external hardware is required for the operation of the Random Pulse Generator. However, the following components may be used for observation and testing:

- **Logic Analyzer**: To observe the pulse output (`uio_out[0]`).
- **Test Bench Environment**: A simulation environment (such as ModelSim, Vivado, etc.) can be used to observe the behavior and functionality of the module.
- **FPGA Board**: If you wish to deploy this on an FPGA, the appropriate hardware setup with a clock input and reset control should be used for operation.

Note: No external devices are required for the pulse generation functionality itself, but additional test equipment can help with observing and verifying the pulse behavior.
